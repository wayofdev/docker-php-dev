## üîç Coding Standards

We use various tools to maintain code quality:

* YAML Lint for YAML files
* Hadolint for Dockerfiles
* Ansible Lint for Ansible files

Run `make lint-yaml`, `make lint-docker`, and `make lint-ansible` to check your code.

Here's a list of tools we use:

### ‚Üí Yaml Lint

We use [`yamllint`](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) to enforce coding standards in YAML files.

To lint yaml files run:

```bash
make lint-yaml
```

by default, [`cytopia/yamllint`](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-yamllint) Docker image will be used to run linter.

### ‚Üí Action Lint

We use [`actionlint`](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) to enforce coding standards in GitHub Actions workflows.

To lint GitHub Actions run:

```bash
make lint-actions
```

by default, [`rhysd/actionlint`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rhysd/actionlint/tags) Docker image will be used to run linter.

### ‚Üí Markdown Lint

We use [`markdownlint-cli2`](https://github.com/davidanson/markdownlint-cli2) to enforce coding standards in Markdown files.

To lint markdown files run:

```bash
make lint-md-dry
make lint-md
```

### ‚Üí Ansible Lint

We use [`ansible-lint`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) to check Ansible playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.

To lint Ansible files, run:

```bash
make lint-ansible
```

<br>

## üß™ Tests

We use [goss](https://github.com/goss-org/goss) and [dgoss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/tree/master/extras/dgoss) for testing our Docker images. These tools allow us to validate the state and behavior of our containers.

### ‚Üí Running Tests

To run tests on the Docker images, use the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This command will build the default image (specified by the `IMAGE_TEMPLATE` variable in the Makefile) and run the goss tests against it.

### ‚Üí Testing Specific Images

To test a specific image variant, you can specify the `IMAGE_TEMPLATE` variable:

```bash
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.3-fpm-alpine"
```

Replace `8.3-fpm-alpine` with the desired PHP version, type, and OS.

### ‚Üí Testing All Images

To test all supported image variants, run:

```bash
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.1-cli-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.1-fpm-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.1-supervisord-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.2-cli-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.2-fpm-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.2-supervisord-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.3-cli-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.3-fpm-alpine"
make test IMAGE_TEMPLATE="8.3-supervisord-alpine"
```

### ‚Üí Test Configuration

The goss test configurations are generated from a Jinja2 template located at `src/Dockerfiles/base/goss.yaml.j2`. This template is used by Ansible to generate specific test configurations for each PHP version, type, and OS combination.

### ‚Üí Writing and Updating Tests

When contributing new features or making changes, please update the `src/Dockerfiles/base/goss.yaml.j2` file. This Jinja2 template defines the tests that will be generated for all image variants. When editing this file:

1. Use Jinja2 syntax for dynamic content that should change based on PHP version, type, or OS.
2. Ensure your tests cover:
    * Presence and correctness of installed PHP extensions
    * Proper configuration of PHP and its extensions
    * Correct functioning of the PHP environment (CLI, FPM, or Supervisord)
    * Any additional features or configurations specific to your changes

After updating the template, regenerate the Dockerfiles and test configurations:

```bash
make generate
```

This command will use Ansible to process the updated template and generate new test configurations for all image variants.

### ‚Üí Continuous Integration

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`test.yml`) automatically runs these tests for each pull request and push to the main branch. Ensure that all tests pass in your local environment before submitting a pull request.

Remember, thorough testing is crucial for maintaining the reliability and consistency of our Docker images across different PHP versions and configurations. By updating the central Jinja2 template, we ensure consistency across all our image variants.

## üì¶ Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are an optional but highly recommended way to automate the linting and quality checks before committing changes to the repository. This project provides a predefined configuration that helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### ‚Üí Configured Hooks

Our pre-commit configuration includes several hooks:

* **Trailing Whitespace**: Removes unnecessary trailing spaces.
* **End-of-File Fixer**: Ensures that files end with a newline.
* **Fix Encoding Pragma**: Adds or removes the coding pragma line at the top of Python files.
* **Check Added Large Files**: Prevents accidentally adding large files to the git repository, with a current limit set to 600 KB.
* **YAML Lint**: Checks YAML files for syntax errors and enforces coding standards using a custom configuration.
* **Commitizen**: Ensures commit messages meet the conventional commit format. This hook is triggered at the commit message stage.
* **Action Validator**: Validates GitHub Actions workflow files.
* **Ansible Lint**: Checks Ansible playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved.
* **Ansible Role Checks**: Several hooks to find issues in Ansible roles:
  * Find unused variables
  * Find empty files
  * Find empty directories
  * Fix readability issues
  * Find undefined handlers
  * Find unquoted values

These hooks help maintain code quality, consistency, and prevent common issues before they are committed to the repository.

### ‚Üí Installing Pre-commit Hooks

To utilize these hooks, you first need to install them using the command provided by the Makefile:

```bash
make hooks
```
